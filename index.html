    <h3>Why I should do this?</h3>
    <p>Cloudflare has an IP reputation system. It scores IP adresses based on their traffic history. Tor has a limited number of exit nodes (that means one IP address means a lot of users, most of them issuing non-malicious requests), and that cause Cloudflare to block by default most of nodes. Users of <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en" target="_blank">Tor Browser</a> deals with dozens CAPTHA challenges a day, because of popularity of Cloudflare and Tor Browser's mechanism to isolate curcuits.</p>
    <p>That looks like this.</p>

    <p><a href="http://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/users/smurdoch/papers/ndss16doyousee.pdf" target="_blank">Research shows</a> that at least 80% Tor exit nodes was blocked by Cloudflare. Research from Cloudflare competitor, <a href="https://akamai.com" target="_blank">Akamai</a>, <a href="https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/2015-q2-cloud-security-report.pdf" target="_blank">shows</a> that Tor users has nearly the same (1:895 vs 1:833) conversion rate as non-Tor users. Akamai concludes: "Many research papers and news articles have proven that the Tor network brings a wide range of risks, but at the same time, most of them completely avoid the fact that there is also business potential to allowing Tor users to browse revenue-generating websites."</p>
